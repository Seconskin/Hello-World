Im making this so i can advance my career and make what the life i know i can. I'm 28 years old, was in the Navy for 6 years as a Nuclear Reactor Operator on Training reactors. I have always loved computers and understand them pretty well. I am looking to finally take my career to the next level and get my dream job.
